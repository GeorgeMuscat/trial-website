<p>This is my first post. I’ve never used Jeykll before so I will be updating the blog as I learn. This</p>

<p>Getting this website hosted was quite painful. My domain registrar “NameSilo” has a domain manager which was easy to used except for the SSL certificates being paywalled.</p>

<p>I was originally going to host the website using GitHub Pages, however I found a website hosting service called “Netlify” which has amazing Jeykll integration, free SSL certificates through <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt.org</a> and an auto-deploy pipeline.</p>
